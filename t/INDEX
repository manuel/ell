* srfi-72.lisp
Tests for datum->syntax adapted from SRFI 72.
* dybvig.lisp
Tests for hygienic macros adapted from ``Writing Hygienic Macros in
Scheme with Syntax-Case'' by Dybvig.  Note that they don't (can't)
test what they should really test (referential transparency), until
ell gets a facility for lexically binding names in the function
namespace.
