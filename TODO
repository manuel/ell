* Bugs
** Create built-in-class as metaclass for built-in classes
Prohibit subclassing of built-in classes and slot accesses to
instances of classes whose metaclass is built-in-class.
** Revisit access to unbound parameters inside parameter init forms
This happens if a parameter's init form accesses a parameter to the right of it.
* Language Issues
** Code created by quasisyntax doesn't use current hygiene context
This means that append-syntax-lists and such cannot be shadowed.  Not
really a problem, but still incorrect.
** What's the deal with macro-writing macros wrt hygiene?
IOW, are macro names symbols or (hygiene-contextual) identifiers?
** Ensure that definitions appear only at the top level
** Ensure that function parameters names' are unique
** Ensure that only optional and keyword parameters have init forms
** Ignore unsyntax inside syntax -- currently uses same normalizer as quasisyntax
* Language Enhancements
** Provide boundp that evaluates argument
Via dlsym(3).
* Code Enhancements
** Keep track of all used symbols in unit and intern them only once at load-time
Also for keyword arguments.
** Allocate string data using GC_alloc_atomic
