* Language Issues
** Ensure that definitions appear only at the top level
** Ensure that function parameters names' are unique
** Ensure that only optional and keyword parameters have init forms
* Code Enhancements
** Cleanup all loops over lists, so that they don't use a counter (except where needed)
** Transform convoluted list_process's and dict_process's to for loops
** Make ellc_args contain pointers, for uniformity with other code
* Compiler Optimizations
** Implement LOC_APP for faster local function calls
When we know that a function call is to a local function, we may omit
the type check, and directly call the function, since the runtime
ensures that function bindings only ever contain functions.  This
would require using a special trap function for unbound functions,
like the trap functions for unbound global functions.  Additionally,
LOC_FREFs would need to check against this trap's address, similarly
to LOC_REFs check against NULL.  However, some architectures seem to
have trouble with comparing function pointers (although its valid
C99), so maybe it's not such a good idea.
* Environment Issues
** Fix Makefile, so that changing ellrt.h isn't silently ignored
