* Language Issues
** Code created by quasisyntax doesn't use current hygiene context
This means that append-syntax-lists and such cannot be shadowed.  Not
really a problem, but still incorrect.
** What's the deal with macro-writing macros wrt hygiene?
IOW, are macro names symbols or (hygiene-contextual) identifiers?
** Ensure that definitions appear only at the top level
** Ensure that function parameters names' are unique
** Ensure that only optional and keyword parameters have init forms
** Ignore unsyntax inside syntax -- currently uses same normalizer as quasisyntax
* Code Enhancements
** Keep track of all used symbols in unit and intern them only once at load-time
